# Description
Python application for creating energy profile diagrams as **'.svg'** files with various aesthetic options. Extra analysis for catalytic cycle diagrams include: Finding energy span, Turn Over Frequency (TOF) estimation from both energy span and *catalytic-flux law*, and estimating degree of TOF control of both intermediates and transition states.¹

# Latest updates
Find energy span of catalytic cycles\
Find the degree of TOF control for intermediates and transition states for catalytic cycles\
Calculate TOF as *catalytic-flux law*

# Installing
The program can ben run directly with python 3.5+ without installation.

```bash
py ./mechaSVG.pyw
```
```bash
python3 ./mechaSVG.pyw
```
```bash
pip3 ./mechaSVG.pyw
```
```bash
python ./mechaSVG.pyw
```
